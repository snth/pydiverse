# Pydiverse #

Diverse set of functions based on the R tidyverse

## Background ##

The lack of a simply equivalent of the `%>%` operator in `R` is often quoted as
an obstacle for data scientists to transition from `R` to `Python`. This
package aims to make that transition a bit easier.

Experienced Python Data Scientists may also find this package to be useful in
their exploratory data analysis.

## Examples ##

* DataFrames
* ggplot
* mapping with toolz and fn
